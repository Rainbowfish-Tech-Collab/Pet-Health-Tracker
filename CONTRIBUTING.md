# Welcome

This open-source project is developed with the purpose of building a robust and user-friendly tool for pet health management, while also fostering a learning environment for developers. The application will feature an intuitive interface, customizable health tracking categories, and data visualization tools. As part of the open-source initiative, contributions are welcomed from developers of all skill levels. Together, we aim to create a tool that not only enhances the lives of pets but also helps developers enhance their coding expertise in areas like web development, mobile development, backend services, APIs, and UI/UX design.

Join us in creating something meaningful while sharpening your development skills! Feel free to fork the repository, contribute to the codebase, and help us make this app even better.
