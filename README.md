# Overview 🐟

## Project Description

Thank you for visiting the Pet Health Tracker project! This project is a collaborative, open-source effort built by a diverse team of developers, designers, and other creatives looking to grow their technical skills and contribute to the pet care community. Whether you're a developer, a pet enthusiast, or someone passionate about health tech, you're in the right place!

The goal of the Pet Health Tracker is to help pet owners log, monitor, and manage their pet's health and well-being. It would allow users to enter pet information, log important health data, view health changes and trends, and more. By providing a simple and centralized platform to track and review these details, pet owners can ensure their beloved animal companions receive the best care possible.

## About Us

The rainbowfish-tech-collab, created by [Char](https://github.com/charburton18) and [Robin](https://github.com/robinallenaz), is a community of tech creatives focused on growing their knowledge of modern technologies, improving their skills with real-world projects, and fostering a positive and supportive learning environment.

### Why is it called "Rainbowfish"?

The Rainbow Fish is a children's book by Marcus Pfister that promotes generosity, kindness, and friendship. Read the story [here](https://milldamschool.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/09/The_rainbow_fish.pdf). Like the Rainbow Fish, we believe we are all better when we share our unique qualities with each other.
